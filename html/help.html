                    <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: var(--color-accent);">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool
                        designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
                        part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br><br>
                        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                        limit
                        work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span
                            style="color: var(--color-accent);">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help
                        users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface. <br><br>

                        It is important to note that <span style="color: var(--color-accent);">Join</span> is designed
                        as an educational exercise and is not intended for
                        extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
                        guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding
                        <span style="color: var(--color-accent);">Join</span>.

                    <h2>How to use it</h2>
                    <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span style="color: var(--color-accent);">Join</span>:

                        <p><span class="instruction-title">Exploring the Board</span><br>
                            When you log in to <span style="color: var(--color-accent);">Join</span>, you'll find a
                            default board. This board represents your project and
                            contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="instructions">

                        <p><span class="instruction-title">Creating Contacts</span><br>
                            In <span style="color: var(--color-accent);">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
                            collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                            click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can
                            be
                            assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>

                        <p><span class="instruction-title">Adding Cards</span><br>
                            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                            tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                            task
                            details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>

                        <p><span class="instruction-title">Moving Cards</span><br>
                            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging
                            and
                            dropping the card from one list to another.</p>

                        <p><span class="instruction-title">Deleting Cards</span><br>
                            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                            card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards,
                            as
                            this action is irreversible. <br><br>
                            Remember that using <span style="color: var(--color-accent);">Join</span> effectively
                            requires consistent updates from you and your team to
                            ensure the board reflects the current state of your project. <br><br>
